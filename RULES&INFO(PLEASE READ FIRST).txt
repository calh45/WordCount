Important notes for use:
- The Project was written in Java 8(1.8)
- A "Main.java" file has been provided to take a input of a filename, this file name must end in ".txt" and have the relevant
  file path (E.g I have placed my test files in the "testFiles" folder so provided a input of "testFiles/testFile.txt")
- If you want to use the WordCount class manually, instantiate a new instance of WordCount, providing the filename String with the same rules listed above
- This API has been written as to work with the English Language, for any other language, please adjust the "LONGEST_WORD" constant with the length of the longest word
  from that language.

Methodology:
1. Confirm openable file exists and open file
2. Loop through each line of the file, splitting the line on the " " regex to partition words into array
3. For each 'word' in array:
   1. Confirm it is not just a " "
   2. Increment word count tally
   3. Pass through function to calculate length of word
   4. Increment corresponding value of lengths array with index equal the length of the word
4. Find max value from array holding word length frequencies
5. Loop through array holding word length frequencies, adding relevant string if the value is above 0
   and adding word length to array holding lengths containing the max frequency
6. Print output to screen

Word Definition Rules:
- Words are split by a " " regex
- A single punctuation character (e.g "$" or "&") shall be defined as a 1 letter word
- Any punctuation (e.g "." "," ";") as the last character of a word shall not be counted towards the length of that word 
  (e.g "Hello." is a 5 letter word much like if it was simply "Hello")
- Multiple " " gaps between words will not be counted as words, as explained before, the split uses " " as a regex and multiple
  " " consecutively will be skipped over if found

The function "getFrequency" is a function implemented purely for ease of use with the unit test suites
